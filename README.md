# Stradivarius
Custom Silly Tavern Presets


The most important thing to know is this: **Most of the toggles and modules in this preset are completely unnecessary for a great experience.** They are powerful tools for when you need them, but they are not required.

#### **Quick Start Guide: How to Use This in 30 Seconds**

1.  Load the **Stradivarius Nexus.json** preset.
2.  Do nothing else. Don't touch any toggles.
3.  Start your roleplay.

That's it. The core engine is designed to give you a dynamic, high-quality experience right out of the box.

### What You Get By Default: The Core Engine

The main prompt, `üîë MAIN Ô∏± Stradivarius`, is the heart of the system. It does two crucial things automatically:

*   **Dynamic Pacing:** Using a bit of macro magic, the AI is forced to randomly change its response structure on **every single turn**. This permanently breaks the repetitive, predictable rhythm of many roleplays. The conversation will feel more natural, with a mix of dialogue-heavy, action-heavy, and introspective moments.
*   **Core Principles:** It contains a set of non-negotiable rules for good storytelling. The AI is constantly reminded to be proactive, to use subtext, to remember past events, and to give visceral, character-driven responses.

Just using this core engine will elevate the quality of any character you use it with. The rest of the system is a full directorial toolkit for when you want to take more specific control.

### The Different Instruments: Specialized Versions for Every Story

While the full **Nexus** version contains every tool, you may want a more focused experience from the start. These lightweight, specialized versions are pre-configured for specific styles of roleplay.

#### **Stradivarius Essentia: The Acoustic Version**

This is Stradivarius in its purest form. It contains the "Core Principles of Performance" but removes the complex randomized pacing and all optional modules.

*   **What it does:** Provides a simple, clean, and highly token-efficient foundation for high-quality roleplay.
*   **When to use it:**
    *   When you need maximum compatibility with any LLM, big or small.
    *   For very long-running stories where token conservation is critical.
    *   When you want a pure, uncomplicated storytelling partner without any mechanical frills.

#### **Stradivarius Anima: The Character Actor's Toolkit**

This version is designed for deep, introspective, and emotionally resonant storytelling. It focuses on the character's inner world, or *anima*.

*   **What it does:** Its random pacing directive prioritizes internal thought and emotional beats. It's pre-configured with modules like `Psychological Depth` and `Scene Atmosphere` enabled to encourage high-quality, literary prose.
*   **When to use it:**
    *   For slow-burn romance, psychological drama, and deep character studies.
    *   When you want the AI to focus on a character's internal conflicts and emotional journey.
    *   For users who value beautifully written, novel-like prose.

#### **Stradivarius Machina: The Game Engine**

This version transforms your roleplay into a TTRPG-like experience, complete with a visual UI and mechanical tracking. It is the *machina* that runs the game.

*   **What it does:** Enables the `Narrative Interface Core` and its addons by default, appending a game-like UI to every response. It's excellent for tracking character condition, equipment, and scene details with precision.
*   **When to use it:**
    *   For running combat encounters, dungeon crawls, or LitRPG scenarios.
    *   When you want to enforce strict continuity regarding character outfits, positioning, and status.
    *   For a more structured, game-like feel to your roleplay.

#### **Stradivarius Kaoso: The Agent of Chaos**

This version "unleashes" the AI's creativity by injecting unpredictability and chaos into the narrative.

*   **What it does:** The randomized pacing directive is expanded with wild, story-altering options like introducing a new character, triggering a sudden flashback, or having a character act completely against their personality.
*   **When to use it:**
    *   When you feel the story is in a rut and you want the AI to surprise you.
    *   For improvisational roleplays where you discover the plot as you go.
    *   When you want to stress-test an AI's creativity and adaptability.

### The Director's Toolkit: Optional Modules & Overrides

These are your camera lenses, your lighting kits, and your directorial notes. They are available in the **Anima, Machina, Kaoso,** and **Nexus** versions and are designed to be toggled on for specific scenes to achieve a desired effect.

Use these to change *how* the AI writes, moment to moment.

    *   **What it does:** Shifts the narrative focus to the psychological states of anticipation, dread, or hesitation.

#### --- üéÆ Game Mechanics (Visuals Only) ---
